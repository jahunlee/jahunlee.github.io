Conceptual Map of My Research Interests\nStatus: in Progress\nMethods: Mixed methods (conjoint experiment and in-depth interviews)\nDescription: This dissertation examines how local governments choose among alternative service delivery modes (in-house provision, contracting out, and hybrid arrangements) as well as partners, under varying institutional, relational, and contextual conditions, with a focus on police patrol and road maintenance services.\nUrban shrinkage—marked by sustained population loss, economic decline, and physical deterioration—constitutes a governing context rather than a discrete policy problem.Rather than focusing on shrinkage as a discrete policy problem, this perspective shifts attention from policy instruments to how governance arrangements, collaboration, and conflict evolve under sustained demographic and structural constraints. While public administration has long examined government responses to fiscal stress and economic downturns, comparatively less attention has been paid to how such long-term demographic and structural change shapes governance choices and interorganizational relationships.The studies presented below examine how demographic shifts shape governance dynamics. I focus empirically on South Korea, an early and extreme case of urban shrinkage, which allows examination of these dynamics under long-term structural constraints that are increasingly observed in advanced economies: Formation and Dissolution of IGOs in Korea (TBD) Status: Writing\nDescription: Shrinking cities face reduced capacity and diminished amenities, potentially increasing incentives for intermunicipal collaboration. This study examines how urban shrinkage shapes the formation and dissolution of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) in Korea, focusing on administrative consultative councils as a key institutional form of interlocal cooperation.

A Study on the Reconceptualization of Sharing and a Case Analysis of the Sharing Economy (Written in Korean; Korean title: 공유의 재개념화와 공유경제 사례분석: 서울시 자동차 공유사례를 중심으로) This study examines collaboration at the community level, focusing on the concept of “sharing.” Since the 2010s, “sharing” has emerged as a prominent rhetorical device in marketing and public policy, often associated with notions of community and collective action. Seoul, the first city to officially declare itself a “Sharing City” in 2012, actively promoted policies and initiatives aimed at fostering a sharing culture. However, the concept of sharing remains analytically ambiguous and contested. To address this ambiguity, the study develops an ideal-typical framework of sharing and applies it to a case analysis of car-sharing in Seoul. Drawing on literature from anthropology, sociology, and business studies, the analysis distinguishes key dimensions of sharing—particularly patterns of behavior (including allocation and commoning practices) and states of possession and ownership—and examines their implications for understanding collaboration in urban communities. - Last updated: Feb. 2026\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Research Interest","level":2,"id":"Research_Interest_0"},{"heading":"Research Agenda","level":2,"id":"Research_Agenda_0"},{"heading":"Dissertation: The Choice of Service Delivery Mode (TBD)","level":4,"id":"Dissertation_The_Choice_of_Service_Delivery_Mode_(TBD)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Urban Shrinkage as a Key Context</em>","level":4,"id":"*Urban_Shrinkage_as_a_Key_Context*_0"},{"heading":"Community-Level Collaboration Facilitated by Local Governments","level":4,"id":"Community-Level_Collaboration_Facilitated_by_Local_Governments_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2_research.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1769993287000,"modifiedTime":1769993287000,"sourceSize":6630,"sourcePath":"2_Research.md","exportPath":"2_research.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":1,"backlinks":["1_about.html"],"type":"markdown"},"index.html":{"title":"HOME","icon":"","description":"Ph.D. Student, Public Administration\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://cuppa.uic.edu/academics/pa/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://cuppa.uic.edu/academics/pa/\" target=\"_self\">Department of Public Policy, Management, and Analytics</a><br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://uic.edu\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://uic.edu\" target=\"_self\">University of Illinois Chicago</a>\n<br>Affiliated Student, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://cuppa.uic.edu/academics/pa/net-gov-lab/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://cuppa.uic.edu/academics/pa/net-gov-lab/\" target=\"_self\">Networks &amp; Governance Lab</a>\n<br>Research Assistant, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://igpa.uillinois.edu\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://igpa.uillinois.edu\" target=\"_self\">Institute of Government and Public Affairs</a>\n<br>✉️ <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"mailto:jlee903@uic.edu\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"mailto:jlee903@uic.edu\" target=\"_self\">jlee903@uic.edu</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Jahun Lee","level":1,"id":"Jahun_Lee_0"}],"links":["mailto:jlee903@uic.edu"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"index.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1769993287000,"modifiedTime":1769993287000,"sourceSize":436,"sourcePath":"index.md","exportPath":"index.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":3,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"3_cv.html":{"title":"3_CV","icon":"","description":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"mailto:jlee903@uic.edu\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"mailto:jlee903@uic.edu\" target=\"_self\">jlee903@uic.edu</a>\nUniversity of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA (Aug. 2021 - Present) Ph.D. student in Public Administration\nCommittee: Michael Siciliano (Chair), Jered Carr, Kelly LeRoux, Kate Albrecht, Jill Tao University of Seoul, Seoul, Korea (Feb. 2016 - Feb. 2018) MPA in Urban Administration\nAdvisor: Tae Young Kim Myongji University, Seoul, Korea (Mar. 2007 - Aug. 2014) BA in Public Administration Research Assistant, Institute of Government and Public Affairs (Aug. 2024 - Present)\nResearcher, Incheon Institute&nbsp;(Mar. 2020 - Jan. 2021; Apr. 2021 - Jul. 2021) Lee, M. &amp; Lee, J.
