A Study on the Reconceptualization of Sharing and a Case Analysis of the Sharing Economy (Korean Title: 공유의 재개념화와 공유경제 사례분석: 서울시 자동차 공유사례를 중심으로) Advisor: Dr. Tae Young Kim\nThis study pertains to collaboration among individuals in urban contexts. Since the 2010s, \"sharing\" has become a rhetorical device in marketing and public policy, carrying connotations of community. However, its multiple and ambiguous meanings often generate debate. This study clarifies the concept of “sharing,” develops an ideal-typical framework, and applies it to a case analysis of car-sharing in Seoul, drawing on literature from anthropology, sociology, and business. This study provides insights by distinguishing different dimensions of “sharing,” particularly behaviors (allocation and commoning practices) and states of possession and ownership, and examining their implications. 김정욱, 이왕기, 이자훈. (2021). 인천광역시 제2기 마을공동체 만들기 기본계획 (The Second Master Plan for Community Building in Incheon Metropolitan City), 인천광역시. Many metropolitan cities and provinces in Korea have implemented community-building initiatives. This policy aims to strengthen the sense of community and cooperation among residents by supporting the formation and activities of community-based organizations, thereby enhancing local autonomy at the neighborhood level. The plan outlines the overall policy framework, ranging from governance arrangements to resident support.
