      I am an assistant professor in Computer Science, Data Science Institute, and Cognitive Science (affiliated) at the University of Chicago. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Social Science group at Microsoft Research. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Percy Liang. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Korea University. My research is at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and natural language processing (NLP).

      My research focuses on Writing with AI, exploring how AI is changing our writing process, the content we create, and our identities as writers. I design and evaluate AI writing assistants (e.g., design space), investigate human-AI collaborative writing processes (e.g., CoAuthor) and conduct user studies, controlled experiments, and surveys to examine the broader implications, such as how AI might shift social norms around authorship, reshape writing education, and influence our everyday communication. I collaborate with researchers across HCI, NLP, and social computing, as well as in fields like education, law, and media.

      My name is Raul Gutierrez Meave. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Administration at the Department of Public Policy, Management and Analytics at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). With a previous Ph.D. in Public Policy from the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics (CIDE), my research focuses broadly on urban governance, policy, and networks.

      I am also an affiliated student of the Networks and Governance Lab at UIC. If you’re interested in learning more about the exciting research we’re working on, I invite you to visit our lab’s website to learn more about our current projects and initiatives.
